# akash_desai_Square_project
# Build tools & versions used
- Xcode 14.2
- iPhone 14 Pro running iOS 16.2 
# Steps to run the app
- Download or clone the app into your local device and run it
- In the EmployeeDirectoryViewModel there is a randomUrl function that you can alter if need be.
# What areas of the app did you focus on?
- I focused on creating a reusable networking codebase that can be easily integrated into future projects and used to connect to additional APIs.
# How long did you spend on this project?
- I spent close to 6 hours
# Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
- Due to the limitations of time prevented me from fully enhancing the app's user interface. Had I been afforded more time, I would have implemented the app using RXSwift, a reactive programming framework, to increase the app's testability and maintainability. Furthermore, I would have instituted more sophisticated error handling and crafted user-facing error messages to enhance the app's user experience. To further improve the app, I would have incorporated a loading animation, by using Lottie or an UIActivityIndicator, to keep users informed about the app's progress. Lastly, I would have implemented a check for internet connectivity to alert users if their device is not connected to the internet.
# What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
- One area where the project could be further optimized is in the handling of errors as they pertain to the user experience. While errors are suitably managed on the backend, the user interface currently only displays a generalized 'No Employees' message in the event of any error. This can be perplexing for the user and could be enhanced by implementing more descriptive and instructive error messages.
# Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!
- Yes I used a swift model generator to create the Employee and EmployeeDirectory models quicker
- I also copied the Scene delegate from an older project and updated the name of the viewController to display
# Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
- As a developing programmer, I aspire to ensure that this project conforms to the desired level of quality for production. I am excited to engage in a meeting with you to discuss the project further and receive constructive criticism on ways to elevate it. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this project and for your review of my submission.
